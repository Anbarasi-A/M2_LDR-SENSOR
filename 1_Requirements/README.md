# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT
 * In many cases, the majority of street lights, outdoor lighting, and a variety of indoor house equipment are manually operated and maintained. This is not only dangerous, but it also wastes energy due to employee negligence or unusual situations when turning on and off these electrical appliances.The resistance changes when light shines on the resistor. These resistors are commonly employed in many circuits that need the detection of light. These resistors come in a range of shapes and sizes, as well as resistance levels.


# INTODUCTION
 * The LDRs are used in a bridge sensor circuit to convert light into voltage, allowing various actions to be performed, such as determining the darkness in the room and turning on or off the light by feeding the voltage signal into the microcontroller.


# PRINCIPLE
 * These devices are light-dependent; when light falls on the LDR, the resistance decreases, while in the dark, it increases. When an LDR is kept in the dark, it has a high resistance, and when it is maintained in the light, it has a lower resistance.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES
 * Atmega 328
 * 3 LEDs
 * voltage source
 * LDR
 * 4 Resistors
 * Audio out

# ADVANTAGES 
 * The wavelength of the incoming light and the semiconductor material determine the sensitivity.
 * The frequency response (the device's capacity to detect rapidly changing optical signals) is quite low.
 * Under bright illumination, photoelectric conversion linearity is weak.

# DISADVANTAGES
 * The frequency response of the ldr light dependent resistor (its capacity to detect rapidly changing optical signals) is quite low.
 * Temperature has a significant impact on it, and it has a slow response time.
 * The illumination of the incident light (photodiode has no flaws, and photodiode sensitivity is higher than LDR sensor), which is a consumable material, affects the delay time between MS and S.

# LIMITATIONS
 * To properly respond to changes in light intensity, they need a few milliseconds or more.
 * Once light is removed, they will need a few seconds to return to their typical dark resistance. 
 * The LDRs' sensitivity and resistance range will differ from one device to the next.
